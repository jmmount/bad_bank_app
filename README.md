BadBank is a simple online banking application built with React and Bootstrap. It allows users to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check account information. The app uses React Router for navigation and uses context to manage user data.

## Features

- User can deposit funds into their account.
- User can withdraw funds from their account.
- Admin can view all user data.

To get started with the BadBank app, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the app.

### Usage

1. Download or clone the repository:

## Future Work

In the future I would love to do the following:
- link the balance variable across components
- Customize the Bootstrap styles
- Add a login
- Connect the data to a backend to keep traack of the user and data
